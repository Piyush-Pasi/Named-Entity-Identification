# Implementing Named Entity Identification using SVM
Code can also be downloaded at [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KvPj-QWDxBco0Dil4bPH2JUnXtchlHr6/view?usp=sharing)


*Platform* : Python Jupyter, Google Colab or VS Code.  
VS Code (version 1.59.0) was used to run the code. 

## Common libraries used in HMM based implementation of WSD
numpy (version 1.19.5)  
pickle (version 4.0)  
regex (version 2019.12.20)  
sklearn (version 0.24.2)  
datasets library is used

## Running NEI_SVM.ipynb

*Run all the cells* for training and testing of SVM model.

## Extra implementation for the last evaluations
***More features added  
Two pass SVM added  
Feature normalization done  
Top 20 feature analysis  
SVM with word embeddings added***

###### Caution:
Run all cells for functions to be defined, Note and Cautions are mentioned in the Notebook as well
